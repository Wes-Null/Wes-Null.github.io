# Global Music Taste: A Clustering Analysis of Spotify Charts

**Live Project Website: https://Wes-Null.github.io**

This project performs a comprehensive clustering analysis on the top songs from Spotify charts across 73 different countries.
The goal is to uncover and visualize regional music tastes, identify global hits, and understand the relationships 
between different international music markets.

The data was initially collected from https://charts.spotify.com/home and the individual
country datasets were combined in Google Colab using Python.
